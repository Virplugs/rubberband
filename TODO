* Fix "!!!" points
* LADSPA plugin has too much "artificial latency"
* LADSPA plugin probably doesn't want to go any higher than about +2 octaves
* Return value check in FFT and resampler!
* sweeps & tones
* ensure default options don't produce garbage at any extreme

DONE * implement+test, or remove, reset()
DONE * Add and test Win32 threading primitives in Thread.cpp
DONE * Threading lock structure is very slow if it becomes starved of CPUs
DONE * Rationalise naming further (e.g. use of "lock" for both peak phases
  and resynchronisation at transients; use of block vs chunk vs frame
  vs window)
DONE * Vamp plugin argument no longer properly reflect internal parameters
DONE * 192kHz
DONE * save/restore FFTW wisdom if using FFTW
DONE * Sort out resynthesis gain
DONE * LADSPA plugin could do with switches for transient/phaselock
DONE * Solve "for very long stretches" issue in calculateSizes()
DONE * Rejig crispness options
