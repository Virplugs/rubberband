Changed in Rubber Band v1.5

 * Add a more reliable transient detection mode, and make the mode
   selectable using OptionDetectorXXX flags -- the new method is
   the default
 * Band-limit transient detectors to avoid being distracted by
   inaudible garbage
 * Add a key-frame mapping facility for variable stretch ratio
   management during offline stretches

The library is binary compatible with version 1.4 for forward
compatibility (a function and an enum have been added, but no existing
entry points have changed).  Code written to use 1.5 is not
necessarily compatible with 1.4.


Changes in Rubber Band v1.4 

 * Fix a hang when faced with some very peculiar stretch factors
 * Fix some incorrect threading condition usage
 * Some code rearrangement
 * Fix build on Solaris

The library is binary compatible with version 1.3.


Changes in Rubber Band v1.3

 * Fix a bug that may cause incorrect output during the first process
   block of some audio files, when processing in offline mode
 * Fix a small number of build issues and more minor bugs

The library is binary compatible with version 1.2.


Changes in Rubber Band v1.2

 * Add an initial "formant preservation" option when pitch shifting
 * Real-time pitch shifting now uses a faster method by default, with
   less variation in CPU usage
 * The code is more amenable to compiler auto-vectorization (through
   e.g. gcc --ftree-vectorize).
