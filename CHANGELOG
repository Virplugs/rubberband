Changes since Rubber Band v1.0.1

 * Added an initial "formant preservation" option when pitch shifting
 * Real-time pitch shifting now uses a faster method by default, with
   less variation in CPU usage
 * The code is more amenable to compiler auto-vectorization (through
   e.g. gcc --ftree-vectorize).
